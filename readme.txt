## About

I’m a huge fan of Underscores, Bootstrap, and Sass. Why not combine these into a solid WordPress Theme Framework?
That’s what UnderStrap is. 
You can use it as starter theme and build your own theme on top of it. Or you use it as parent theme and create your own child theme for UnderStrap.

At the moment, UnderStrap is in a very early stage. But if you want, feel free to use it for your own WordPress theme!

## Starter Theme + HTML Framework = WordPress Theme Framework

The _s theme is a good starting point to develop a WordPress theme. But it is “just” a raw starter theme. That means it outputs all the WordPress stuff correctly but without any layout or design.
Why not add a well known and supported layout framework to have a solid, clean and responsive foundation? That’s where Bootstrap comes in.

## Confused by All the CSS and Sass Files?

Some basics about the Sass and CSS files that come with UnderStrap:
- The theme itself uses the `/style.css`file just to identify the theme inside of WordPress. The file is not loaded by the theme and does not include any styles.
- The `/css/theme.css` and it´s minified little brother `/css/theme.min.css` file(s) provides all styles. It is composed of five different SCSS sets and one variable file at `/sass/theme.scss`:

                  - 1 "theme/theme_variables";  // <--------- Add your variables into this file. Also add variables to overwrite Bootstrap or UnderStrap variables here
                  - 2 "../src/bootstrap-sass/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap";  // <--------- All the Bootstrap stuff - Don´t edit this!
                  - 3 "understrap/understrap"; // <--------- Some basic WordPress stylings and needed styles to combine Boostrap and Underscores
                  - 4 "../src/fontawesome/scss/font-awesome"; // <--------- Font Awesome Icon styles

                  // Any additional imported files //
                  - 5 "theme/theme";  // <--------- Add your styles into this file

- Don’t edit the files no. 2-4 files/filesets or you won’t be able to update it without overwriting your own work!
- Your design goes into: `/sass/theme`. Add your styles to the `/sass/theme/_theme.scss` file and your variables to the `/sass/theme/_theme_variables.scss`. Or add other .scss files into it and `@import` it into `/sass/theme/_theme.scss`.

## Installation

- Download the understrap folder from GitHub or from understrap.com
- IMPORTANT: If you download it from GitHub make sure you rename the "understrap-master.zip" file just to "understrap.zip" or you might have problems using child themes !!
- Upload it into your WordPress installation subfolder here: `/wp-content/themes/`
- Login to your WordPress backend
- Go to Appearance → Themes
- Activate the UnderStrap theme

## Developing With npm, Gulp and SASS and [Browser Sync][1]

### Installing Dependencies
- Make sure you have installed Node.js and Browser-Sync* (* optional, if you wanna use it) on your computer globally
- Then open your terminal and browse to the location of your UnderStrap copy
- Run: `$ npm install` and then: `$ gulp copy-assets`

### Running
To work and compile your Sass files on the fly start:

- `$ gulp watch`

Or, to run with Browser-Sync:

- First change the browser-sync options to reflect your environment in the file `/gulpfile.js` in the beginning of the file:
```javascript
var browserSyncOptions = {
    proxy: "localhost/theme_test/", // <----- CHANGE HERE
    notify: false
};
```
- then run: `$ gulp watch-bs`

## How to Use the Build-In Widget Slider

The front-page slider is widget driven. Simply add more than one widget to widget position “Hero”.
- Click on Appearance → Widgets.
- Add two, or more, widgets of any kind to widget area “Hero”.
- That’s it.
